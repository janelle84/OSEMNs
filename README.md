## About

The OSEMN framework breaks down the data science workflow into five key stages:
1. **Obtain**: Data acquisition from various sources (APIs, web scraping, databases, etc.).
2. **Scrub**: Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure quality.
3. **Explore**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights.
4. **Model**: Building and tuning predictive or descriptive models.
5. **Interpret**: Deriving actionable insights and communicating results effectively.
